                I am a student and a member of ITS's network operation division at Iowa State unversity. However, in my
                free
                time I am also a member of ISU's PRISUM solar car team, and am the former assistant electrical director.

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                    only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                    creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                    Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                    text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                    two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                    related to the project itself.</p>

                <p>
                    At ISU's solar car team, PRISUM, I specifically worked on the EVCC software for P15 Eliana.
                    The system mainly functioned as a means to allow our car to be race ready and charge via standard
                    J177
                    EV chargers
                    you could find in places like your local walgreens.

                <p>
                    This project was mainly done in C, with a little bit of Assembly.

                    On the side, I have been working on a tabletop role playing system called 'Calamari'. Said project
                    was originally built off
                    of a homebrew Table Top Role Playing Game me and my friends have been using, and we thought that the
                    system could be published.
